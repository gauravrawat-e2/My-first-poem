 " Hostel "<br>
Entry in the hostel room<br>
Beds were three and,<br>
Adjusting 5 in them was a key.<br>
Then cleaning the room is the big task,<br> 
But no one is actually interested in that part.<br>
Everyone's reaction on food of mesh,<br>
Let's eat something else.<br>
Movies were our nights,<br>
And breaking someone's things made us laugh hard after fights.<br>
Books were fired when it is too cold and lights went off,<br>
Break time in exams was always a round off.<br>
To send a message it is very hard to request for net,<br>
And asking for party after every bet.<br>
Late night room study used to be tough,<br>
But hearing roommate's songs make us laugh.<br>
Waiting for gulabjamun on sundays,<br>
Butts turned red on birthdays.<br>
Asking stupid questions before sleeping,<br>
And then replying answers that make no sense made night entertaining.
