 " Hostel "
Entry in the hostel room
Beds were three and, 
Adjusting 5 in them was a key.
Then cleaning the room is the big task, 
But no one is actually interested in that part.
Everyone's reaction on food of mesh,
Let's eat something else.
Movies were our nights,
And breaking someone's things made us laugh hard after fights.
Books were fired when it is too cold and lights went off,
Break time in exams was always a round off.
To send a message it is very hard to request for net, 
And asking for party after every bet.
Late night room study used to be tough,
But hearing roommate's songs make us laugh.
Waiting for gulabjamun on sundays,
Butts turned red on birthdays.
Asking stupid questions before sleeping,
And then replying answers that make no sense made night entertaining.
